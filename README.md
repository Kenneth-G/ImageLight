## About.
I decided to make an image viewer because it was something I would use. While Windows does come with the Photo's app it just has so many additional features I would never use. I wanted to try and make something similar to the discontinued "Windows Photo Viewer" that came with Windows XP, Visa & 7 where if I opened a image, it would just show me that image along with some navigation. 

## Technologies. 
### Languages:
- Java 11

### JDK
- [AdoptOpenJDK.](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

It is primilary built using [JavaFX 11.](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/)
I decided to keep the JDK & Libaries at version 11 as they provide Long term support. 
With the recent changes to Oracle JDK distribution, I've decided to use the AdoptOpenJDK.
